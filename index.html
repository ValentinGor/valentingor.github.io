                                    This experience helped me grow into a more seasoned Frontend Developer, able to
                                    handle more complex projects and work effectively within teams. It also solidified
                                    my ability to take full ownership of projects, from conception to completion, with a
                                    focus on performance and user experience.

                                    In my first professional role, I focused on creating responsive websites using HTML
                                    and CSS, paying close attention to clean and maintainable code. This experience
                                    allowed me to:

                                        Accurately transform designs into functional web pages, improving my front-end
                                        development skills and client communication.

                                        Start working with modern tools like Gulp and SCSS, which optimized my workflow
                                        and increased efficiency.

                                        Lay the groundwork for deeper specialization in front-end development and
                                        transitioning to more complex projects.
                                    </li>

                                    I gained essential technical skills and developed a professional approach to my
                                    work, which helped me quickly move on to more challenging roles and confidently
                                    advance my career in IT.
